# Trello Automation Power-Up ðŸš€

### Instructions

You need to serve that app to use on your trello boards, for that there is a node script server.js on the project root you could run that using:

```
npm run start
``` 

That will only work for local tests to use on trello you need to use a host like AWS, digital ocean, heroku, etc.

After that you need to access that page to enable custom power up on trello:
